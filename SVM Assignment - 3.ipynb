    "In order to predict house prices based on several characteristics, such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, etc., Mean Absolute Error (MAE) would be the best regression metric to employ. MAE measures the average magnitude of errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. This is important in the context of predicting house prices, as we want to be able to accurately estimate the average deviation of our predictions from the actual prices, without worrying about the direction of the deviation. Other regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) could also be used, but they would give more weight to larger errors, which might not be desirable in this situation."

One such metric is the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), which is less sensitive to outliers than the Mean Squared Error (MSE).
