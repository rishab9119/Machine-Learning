    "Grid Search CV (Cross-Validation) is a hyperparameter tuning technique used in machine learning to find the optimal set of hyperparameters for a model. Hyperparameters are model parameters that are not learned from the data, but rather set before training, such as learning rate, regularization strength, number of hidden layers in a neural network, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of grid search is to exhaustively search through a defined hyperparameter space and find the combination of hyperparameters that results in the best model performance. It works by creating a grid of all possible hyperparameter values that the model can take, and then systematically evaluating each combination of hyperparameters using cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how grid search CV works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the hyperparameter space: First, the hyperparameter space is defined, which is a range of values that each hyperparameter can take. For example, if the hyperparameter is learning rate, the range could be [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0].\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create the grid: A grid is created by taking the Cartesian product of all the possible values for each hyperparameter. For example, if there are two hyperparameters, learning rate and regularization strength, and their ranges are [0.001, 0.01] and [0.1, 1.0], respectively, then the grid would contain four combinations: (0.001, 0.1), (0.001, 1.0), (0.01, 0.1), and (0.01, 1.0).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Fit the model with each combination: For each combination of hyperparameters, a new model is trained on the training data using cross-validation, and the model's performance is evaluated on the validation data. The evaluation metric can be set according to the problem, for example, accuracy, AUC, or F1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Choose the best hyperparameters: After evaluating all the combinations, the hyperparameters that result in the best model performance are chosen. This is typically the combination with the highest score on the evaluation metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search CV helps to automate the process of hyperparameter tuning and systematically search through a large space of possible hyperparameters. By tuning the hyperparameters, we can improve the model's performance and generalize better to new data."

    "Grid search CV and Randomized search CV are two popular hyperparameter tuning techniques used in machine learning. Both methods involve a search over a set of hyperparameters, but they differ in how they explore the hyperparameter space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between grid search CV and randomized search CV is the way they generate candidate hyperparameters to evaluate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search CV performs an exhaustive search over all possible hyperparameter values defined in a given range, whereas Randomized search CV randomly samples a defined number of hyperparameters from a distribution defined by the user.\n",

    "Here are some differences between grid search CV and randomized search CV:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Search Space: Grid search CV works best when the search space is small and has a limited number of hyperparameters. Randomized search CV is more suitable when the search space is large and complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computation Time: Grid search CV can be computationally expensive since it exhaustively evaluates all combinations of hyperparameters, while randomized search CV can be faster since it samples a smaller subset of hyperparameters from the search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Exploration vs Exploitation: Randomized search CV allows for greater exploration of the hyperparameter space since it samples from a larger space of possible hyperparameters, while grid search CV is more focused on exploiting the given search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Search Efficiency: Randomized search CV can often achieve similar or better performance than grid search CV with fewer iterations, due to its ability to explore the search space more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use Grid Search CV versus Randomized Search CV depends on the size of the search space, the complexity of the model, and the computational resources available. If the search space is small and computationally feasible, grid search CV can provide a comprehensive and exhaustive search. On the other hand, if the search space is large and complex, or computational resources are limited, randomized search CV can provide a more efficient search.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, both grid search CV and randomized search CV are useful for hyperparameter tuning, but the choice of which method to use depends on the complexity of the problem, the size of the hyperparameter space, and the available computational resources."

For example, in a loan approval dataset, including information on whether the loan was ultimately approved or not would be considered target leakage, since this information would not be available at the time of prediction.\n",

The dataset includes a feature indicating whether a customer made a purchase in the previous month. If we include this feature in our model, it would be considered target leakage, since the information about whether a customer made a purchase in the previous month would not be available at the time of prediction. This could result in an overly optimistic model that performs well on the training and test data, but fails to generalize to new data, since it is making predictions based on information that would not be available in the future.
