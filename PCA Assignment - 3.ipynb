    "Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are concepts in linear algebra that are closely related to the eigen-decomposition approach.\n",

It involves constructing an eigenface basis by computing the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of a set of face images. These eigenvectors represent facial features, and each face image can be reconstructed as a linear combination of the eigenfaces. Eigenfaces enable efficient face recognition by comparing the coefficients of eigenface representations.\n",
