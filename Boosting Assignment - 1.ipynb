    "Boosting is an ensemble learning technique in machine learning that combines multiple weak learners (i.e., models that are slightly better than random guessing) to create a strong learner. It is an iterative process that involves training a sequence of weak learners, where each learner focuses on the instances that were misclassified by the previous learner. The idea behind boosting is to correct the errors of the previous learners and improve the overall accuracy of the model. By the end of the boosting process, the weak learners are combined into a single strong learner that can make accurate predictions on new data."

By doing this, the algorithm gradually improves its overall accuracy and reduces the error rate. The final prediction is then made by taking a weighted sum of the predictions of all the weak learners. The weights of each weak learner are determined by its individual accuracy on the training set, with more accurate learners receiving higher weights."
