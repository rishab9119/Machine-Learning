The goal is to find the best-fit line that describes the linear relationship between the two variables. For example, a simple linear regression can be used to study the relationship between a person's age and their income. The age would be the independent variable, and the income would be the dependent variable.\n",

    "Linear regression is a statistical technique used to study the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. There are several assumptions that must be met for linear regression to be a valid model for the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main assumptions of linear regression are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linearity: The relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable(s) should be linear. This means that the slope of the regression line should remain constant across the entire range of values for the independent variable(s).\n",

    "* Independence: The observations should be independent of each other. This means that the value of one observation should not be related to the value of another observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Homoscedasticity: The variance of the errors should be constant across all levels of the independent variable(s). In other words, the spread of the residuals should be the same across the entire range of values for the independent variable(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Normality: The residuals should be normally distributed. This means that the errors should be distributed around zero and follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset, there are several methods that can be used. One common method is to plot the residuals against the fitted values. If the plot shows a random pattern with no discernible pattern or trend, then the assumptions of linearity and homoscedasticity are likely met.\n",

    "To check for normality, a histogram or Q-Q plot of the residuals can be created. If the plot shows a bell-shaped curve or a straight line, respectively, then the assumption of normality is likely met.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, checking the assumptions of linear regression is an important step in evaluating the validity of the model for the data. Various plots and tests can be used to assess the assumptions of linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality."

Therefore, by negating the gradient, we can move in the direction of the steepest decrease of the function.\n",
